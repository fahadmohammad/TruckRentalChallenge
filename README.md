# TruckRentalChallenge
GOAL: Have to calculate the cost to rent a truck
The rental terms are $25 for the first hour and $50 for each additional hour.
Round up to the next hour after 10 minutes. For a full day rental the rates are: 
$400 for each weekdays
$200 for each weekend(eg: sat,sun). 
12 hours is counted as a business day,  not 24 hours.
We have to write methods in such a way so that the logic does not have to change
if we adjust that rule again (eg: Instead of $25 for the first hour, we are changing it to
be $5 for the first 20 minutes)
